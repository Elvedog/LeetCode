Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.
A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Convert the list to a set for O(1) average time complexity for lookups
        num_set = set(nums)
        
        longest_streak = 0  # Initialize the longest streak to 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the set
        for num in num_set:
            # Check if it's the start of a sequence
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current_num = num
                current_streak = 1
                
                # Count the length of the consecutive sequence starting from num
                while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                    current_num += 1
                    current_streak += 1
                
                # Update the longest streak if the current streak is longer
                longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)
        
        return longest_streak
