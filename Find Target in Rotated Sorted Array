#You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # If the target is found, return its index
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            # Determine if the left half is sorted
            if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
                # Check if the target is within the left half
                if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            # Otherwise, the right half must be sorted
            else:
                # Check if the target is within the right half
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
        
        # If we exit the loop, the target is not present
        return -1
